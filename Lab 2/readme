In this lab, I selected a spam email dataset from Kaggle.
The task is a supervised classification problem where the goal is to classify emails as either spam or ham.
The target variable represents the email label spam or ham.
The model is expected to learn patterns from the email features and accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate emails.
